        "Once poverty is gone, we'll need to build museums to display its
        horrors to future generations. They'll wonder why poverty continued so
        long in human society - how a few people could live in luxury while
        billions dwelt in misery, deprivation and despair.People.. were poor not
        because they were stupid or lazy. They worked all day long, doing
        complex physical tasks. They were poor because the financial institution
        in the country did not help them widen their economic base."
